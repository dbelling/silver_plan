## Intro
I've opted to use Python for this silver plan analysis because it contains
several open-source libraries (namely, Pandas) which are well-suited
for solving diverse problems. It's also a nice easy-to-use interpreted language, 
and a farcry from my roots with MATLAB.

## Setup
You will need the python package installer, pip. This is generally included with
most versions of Python 2 & 3, but if `which pip` fails, you can grab the install
script [here](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py). Then, run the installer:

```bash
python get-pip.py
```

You can now install other packages through the pip CLI. Let's grab the pandas library:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

That's it! We're all set to dig into some data.
